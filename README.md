## About Me

My journey in Android development began with courses by Andrey
Sumin, available on popular platforms like Stepik and Udemy. These
courses provided an excellent foundation for understanding the
basic principles of Android development. After completing the
courses and creating a pet project, I started working remotely at
TopMyApp, where I developed simple projects, reinforcing my
knowledge through practical experience. When the company
stopped developing Android apps and focused solely on iOS, I
began searching for new opportunities. Soon, I joined Entexy, a small
company creating various custom projects, where I continue to
work to this day.
