## About Me

In programming, I started with C# and Desktop development
but found my true passion in the world of Java and
Android development.

Guided by Andrey Sumin's courses, I switched from Java to Kotlin, based on the relevance of this language. Mastering Android development fundamentals, I applied knowledge in real-world scenarios, handling client requests.

Striving for improvement, I continue to move in this direction,
striving to get both theoretical knowledge and practical
experience.
