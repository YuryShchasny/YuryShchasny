- # About Me

In the world of programming, my journey began with the exploration of C# and initial forays into Desktop development. Despite the initial interest, this experience didn't immediately captivate my soul. In the pursuit of finding a direction that resonated with me, I immersed myself in the captivating realm of Java, discovering the fascinating field of Android development.

My initial steps in Android development were fortified by courses from the talented instructor, Andrey Sumin. Starting with Java, I gradually transitioned to Kotlin, finding in it my ideal environment for creativity. Throughout the learning process, I mastered the fundamentals of Android development, expanding my skill set.

In the midst of delving into the basics of Android development, I actively pursued both learning and work simultaneously, applying the acquired knowledge in practical scenarios. During this period, I handled requests for developing Android applications for clients, significantly broadening my practical experience and deepening my understanding of development processes.

My commitment to improvement and the pursuit of optimal solutions consistently accompany me in the world of development. I enthusiastically tackle all new challenges, driven by a focus on continuous professional growth and diversity in my creative journey.
